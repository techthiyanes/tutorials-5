# Fancy Runhouse 🧑‍🎨 - Dreambooth and TIMM in <10 Minutes

_Watch time: ~6 minutes_

We want Runhouse to be aggressively zero-lift. Whatever code
structure, whatever execution environment (notebook, 
orchestrator, data app, CI/CD), you should be able to do something fun
and interesting with Runhouse in minutes, not months.
