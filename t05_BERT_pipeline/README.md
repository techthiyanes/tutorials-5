# A Runhouse Pipeline 👩‍🔧 - Fine-tuning BERT on Multiple GPUs and Deploying

_Watch time: ~10 minutes_

Runhouse is designed to make interacting with shared, heterogeneous
hardware and data resources feel easy and natural. We'll test this 
by performing the various stages of a simple ML workflow all in
eager Python, touching several types of hardware and data 
storage. You'll see how many of the resources we create along
the way are general-purpose, and suitable to be reused among 
a team.

This tutorial will demonstrate BERT fine-tuning for sentiment analysis
using the Yelp reviews dataset, largely based on this [Hugging Face 
tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training).
